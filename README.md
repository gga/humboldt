# Humboldt

A framework for benchmarking applications and systems. You write a
script composed of users to exercise your application. Humboldt
provides hooks to collect data, including from within your
application.

At the end of the run, results are gathered and reported.

Theoretically supports collecting results from distributed workers and
applications, though this hasn't yet been exercised.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem '.'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install .
