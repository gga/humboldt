# Humboldt

A framework for benchmarking applications and systems. You write a
script composed of users to exercise your application. Humboldt
provides hooks to collect data, including from within your
application.


At the end of the run, results are gathered and reported.

Theoretically supports collecting results from distributed workers and
applications, though this hasn't yet been exercised.
